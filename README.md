# What is Todey?

Todey at its core is a task managing application.  It provides user authentication so you know your data will be secure and so that you can keep your lists of tasks private.
Users can add as many lists of tasks as they desire and any number of tasks in each list.

# Installation
The project can be cloned locally.  It will need environment variables set up for a development database.


# Usage
Once the user opens the application they are prompted to login into their accout.  If they do not have an account they navigate to a page to register for an account on the navigation bar.  After they are logged in they see a sidebar of all of their lists of tasks.  There is an input box to create a new list or they can click on an existing list to show a list of tasks for that list.  They can then mark the task as completed or edit the task to something completely different.  Once you are finished using the application you can logut by clicking the logout button on the navigation bar.

# Planned Features
A list of important tasks where the user can "star" any task and it will be in their important collection.
Adding email support so a user will receive welcome email and so a user can reset their password.
